# Fraud-detection SQL Patterns

This repository contains SQL queries used to detect potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity.

The purpose is to demonstrate how business rules can be translated into structured data queries.

These examples are illustrative and focus on:

- Transaction velocity
- Duplicate account detection
- Suspicious behavioural patterns

## Why this matters

Fraud detection often begins with simple rule-based detection before more advanced modelling is applied.

Well-structured SQL queries can surface early warning indicators for investigation.
